    Find a landmark point by searching for the most convex horizontal cross-section.
    
    This function searches upward from a starting point, analyzing horizontal slices
    of the mesh to find where the body is most convex (rounded) or least concave (indented).
    It's used to locate landmarks like the crotch (most convex point between legs) or
    armpits (transition from concave to convex).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
        The mesh to search through (should be oriented with Z-axis vertical)
    rays : int
        Number of rays to cast radially at each height (more rays = finer resolution)
        Typical value: 50-100
    origin : np.ndarray, default=[0, 0, 0]
        Starting point for the search (X, Y, Z coordinates)
        Search proceeds upward from origin[2]
    max_iter : int, default=20
        Maximum number of horizontal slices to analyze
    slice_width : float, default=0.005
        Vertical distance between consecutive slices
        Total search height = max_iter * slice_width
    convexity_threshold : float, default=0.05
        Threshold for "convex enough" (0.05 means 95% convex)
        If a slice is >= (1 - threshold) convex, return immediately
    
    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The 3D coordinates [x, y, z] of the landmark point (center of most convex slice)
    
    Examples
    --------
    Find the crotch (most convex point between legs):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from convexity_search import convexity_search  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> mesh = trimesh.load("model_files/man.obj")  # doctest: +SKIP

    Crotch at: [0.0, 0.0, 20.5]
    
    Pseudocode
    ----------
    1. Initialize ray directions (radially outward in XY plane)
    2. For each height from origin[2] to origin[2] + max_iter * slice_width:
        a. Cast rays horizontally through the mesh at this height
        b. Find intersection points with mesh surface
        c. Compute centroid of intersection points
        d. Group intersections by ray direction
        e. Keep only outermost point per ray
        f. Order points into a loop around the centroid
        g. Compute convexity = area / convex_hull_area
        h. If convexity >= threshold, return centroid immediately
    3. If no slice meets threshold, return centroid of most convex slice
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Convexity score of 1.0 means perfectly convex (circular cross-section)
    - Convexity score < 1.0 indicates concavity (indentations)
    - The function searches upward, so set origin to start below the landmark
    - Ray count affects precision: more rays = smoother cross-section but slower
    - Slice width affects sensitivity: smaller = finer search but more iterations
    
    Algorithm Details
    -----------------
    The convexity score is computed as:
        convexity = polygon_area / convex_hull_area
    
    Where:
    - polygon_area: Area of the actual cross-section at this height
    - convex_hull_area: Area of the smallest convex polygon containing the cross-section
    
    If the cross-section is already convex, these areas are equal (convexity = 1.0).
    If there are concave regions (like armpits), polygon_area < convex_hull_area.

def assign_points_to_rays(points, directions, centroid):

    Assign each intersection point to the ray direction it aligns with most.
    
    When rays are cast through a mesh, multiple intersection points may align with
    the same ray (if the ray passes through multiple parts of the mesh). This function
    groups all intersection points by which ray direction they're closest to (in angle).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    points : np.ndarray, shape (N, 3)
        Intersection points from ray casting
    directions : np.ndarray, shape (M, 3)
        Ray directions (unit vectors)

        Center point to measure angles from
    
    Returns
    -------
    list of lists
        Length M list where assigned[i] contains all points aligned with directions[i]

    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> # assigned[0] contains points near direction [1,0,0]
    >>> # assigned[1] contains points near direction [0,1,0]
    
    Pseudocode
    ----------
    1. Create empty list for each ray direction
    2. For each intersection point:
        a. Compute vector from centroid to point
        b. Normalize to unit vector
        c. Compute dot product with all ray directions
        d. Find ray with maximum dot product (smallest angle)
        e. Add point to that ray's list
    3. Return list of lists
    
    Notes
