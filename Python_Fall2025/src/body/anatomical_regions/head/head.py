class Head(Anatomical_Region):
    """
    Head region segmentation, landmark detection, and measurement computation.
    
    The Head class handles extraction and analysis of the head from a full body mesh.
    It identifies the head by slicing above the shoulders and locates key facial
    landmarks (tip of nose) for measurements (head height from collar to scalp).
    
    Purpose
    -------
    This class solves the problem of automatically isolating and measuring the head
    region from body scans. Without this class, you would need to manually:
    - Determine where the neck/shoulders end and head begins
    - Slice the mesh to extract just the head
    - Locate facial landmarks
    - Compute head dimensions
    
    With this class, creating a Head instance automatically performs all these operations.
    
    Class Structure and Design Choices
    -----------------------------------
    **Simpler than other regions**:
    The Head class is architecturally simpler than Arm or Leg because:
    - No left/right distinction needed (there's only one head)
    - Fewer landmarks (just nose tip currently)
    - Simpler segmentation (single horizontal plane cut)
    
    This makes Head a good starting point for understanding the codebase.
    
    **Static method with @cache**:
    See Anatomical_Region docstring for the rationale behind this design pattern.
    
    **Runtime imports**:
    `from ..arms import Arm` appears inside methods because:
    - Head depends on Arm (to find shoulders for slicing plane)
    - Arm may depend on Head (for full body segmentation)
    - Runtime imports break circular dependency at import time
    
    **Shoulder-based slicing**:
    The head is extracted by:
    1. Finding both shoulder landmarks (from Arm class)
    2. Taking the maximum Z-coordinate (higher shoulder)
    3. Slicing above this plane to keep only the head
    
    This approach assumes:
    - Shoulders are the highest non-head points
    - Body is upright (Z-axis vertical)
    - Shoulder detection succeeds
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    body_mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
        The full body mesh (cleaned and oriented)
    
    Properties
    ----------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
        The segmented head mesh (cached, computed on first access)
    landmarks : dict[str, np.ndarray]
        Key anatomical points:
        - "tip of nose": Most forward-protruding point of face
        Note: More landmarks (eyes, ears) could be added in future
    measurements : dict[str, float]
        Anthropometric measurements:
        - "collar to scalp length": Vertical distance from neck to top of head
        Note: More measurements (head circumference) could be added in future
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import trimesh
    >>> from body import Body  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> body = Body("model_files/man.obj")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> head = body.parts["head"]  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> head_height = head.measurements["collar to scalp length"]  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(f"Head height: {head_height:.2f} cm")  # doctest: +SKIP
    Head height: 23.5 cm
    
    >>> nose_tip = head.landmarks["tip of nose"]  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(f"Nose tip location: {nose_tip}")  # doctest: +SKIP
    Nose tip location: [0.2, 8.5, 62.3]
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Requires body mesh to be in standard orientation (Z-axis vertical)
    - Shoulder detection quality affects head segmentation accuracy
    - Currently limited landmarks and measurements (expandable in future)
    - All measurements are in the same units as the input mesh
